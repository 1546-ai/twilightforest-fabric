SCP-3999 is to be contained with several of these with no less than 3 enchantments each and each enchantment must be a non-prime number, but instead be members of Amazon prime. Researcher Talloran is to be stripped of his Amazon Prime memebership as well as his 1 PB external storage drive filled with various modded memes including clay buckets, Draconic Evolution is balanced because it takes effort, Direfall clips, and various copies that are different versions neat mod. Each of these memes are to be thoroughly inspected by a member of Forgecraft and then posted to the said Forgecraft Member's Twitter account. With each meme posted, they are to be fed to cake, and testing will be concluded for 2^31-1 ticks. After each conclusion, the resulting Experiment 115 will be stowed away in the laboratories for later consumption."
